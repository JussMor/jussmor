It’s been four years since my story as a remote tech worker began.

When I was a teenager, I never thought much about my future. I didn’t know what I wanted or what I should do with my life. As a kid, I was more interested in stars, the universe, fantasy, and honestly, in destroying everything around me just because I was curious.

I grew up in a low-income family in a poor country in South America, and going to university seemed expensive and, at times, even irrelevant. But thanks to a stroke of luck or the alignment of the stars, I was able to go, and I became a mechanical engineer. I chose that path because it aligned with my curiosity. I still remember how fascinated I was by physics, chemistry, thermodynamics, electronics, and even the basics of programming.

I also remember my second year of university vividly. I failed my first programming course. I was furious. I couldn't understand why programming was so difficult for me. I cried because I had promised my parents I would never fail a course. Time was precious, and money was limited.

I never really asked where my parents got the money for my education. I often chose not to think about it. During those years, a friend and I joined an NGO program, and we ended up winning a trip to the U.S. for an entrepreneurship event. That opportunity allowed my professor to approve my failed course. I still remember I had a ticket to attend a program at Hult Business School in Boston, but no money to go. That year, I worked hard and sold many things just to fund the experience.

When I arrived in the U.S., I didn’t speak English, I had no money, and I was just a kid with dreams. Dreams of becoming an entrepreneur. Seeing the projects and ideas from the other participants opened my eyes to what I needed to change in my life. I was tired of trying to create opportunities in Ecuador, where bureaucracy crushed motivation. That trip gave me clarity and direction.

Over the years, I used every free moment to gain the skills I needed. I learned English, and I returned to programming because I refused to accept that I couldn’t understand it. Throughout my life, I worked as a designer, painter, agricultural laborer, and construction worker. I met people and learned from them in ways that you can't even imagine. Today, I believe that desperation can be a powerful weapon when channeled correctly.

## My First Job

My first job came from a reference. Someone called me and said, “Someone told me you're smart. I need to build a web app. Can you help me?”

My first instinct was panic. I thought, I don’t have the skills for this. But then, for the first time, I changed my mindset. I said, I don’t know how to do it, but I know someone who does.

So, I called a friend, and he agreed to help. Together, we built a platform to help students with their homework. It was a great success during the COVID-19 pandemic, even though the platform doesn’t exist anymore.

That project eventually ended, and I had to look for new opportunities.

## The Path to a New Challenge: Working Abroad

I still remember how hard it was to tell my parents I didn’t want to work in the field I had studied for five years. Their dream was for me to get a government job, but that wasn’t my path. My first tech job was a secret. When I landed my first international contract, they thought it was just a phase, but it wasn’t.

At the end of that year, I set a resolution to find a new job. I sent out countless resumes, mostly to Spanish-speaking companies, but received no responses. Then it hit me. I knew English. I wasn’t fluent, but I had enough to try. So, I started applying for jobs that required English.

After a few weeks, I received several interview invitations, but I rejected many of them out of fear. Eventually, I realized I couldn’t keep running from opportunities. I had to face the fear. Impostor syndrome was real and powerful, but I couldn’t let it sabotage me anymore. It's like being in a dark cave with a door you know how to open but still choosing not to.

My first interview was a disaster. But then came another, and another. I improved a little each time. One day, I received a message: “Junior, you look like a perfect match for us. We’re looking for someone with basic dev knowledge but great potential to grow.” - Jobsity

I completed the recruitment process, and it was a success. After many failures, I often forget how hard it was to reach that level of professionalism. Writing this now reminds me that with consistency and passion, we can do anything we set our minds to.

## My First International Experience

It came with many insecurities and doubts. We can’t know or control everything. At the start of this experience, I thought I was a failure who didn’t deserve the job. When we read job descriptions, we often believe we must know everything, but that’s impossible.

What we can do is master the basics and build from there. If you understand the fundamentals, you can learn anything quickly. Trust yourself.

I remember those first meetings, speaking in English, thinking, they can’t understand me. But discomfort is where growth begins. I chose not to complain but to look for solutions. I ended each workday with a walk, talking to myself about what I did that day and what I would do tomorrow. The more you practice, the better you become.

Starting is always hard. But if I compare who I was then to who I am now and what I can solve today, I’m proud.

Thanks to dedication during these three amazing years, I’ve been able to:

- Improve my English
- Collaborate with international teams
- Learn new technologies
- Manage complex projects from start to finish
- Strengthen my soft skills across departments
- Work with AI from its early stages

## Conclusion: Where I Am and What I’m Doing

Today, I work in the healthcare sector. I’m learning Portuguese because I work with developers from Brazil, and it’s been a fascinating experience. I still live in my small town, but I’m building things that are making a difference around the world.

If you're a developer looking for your next challenge, my best advice is: never give up. Make a commitment to yourself and take the next step in your career. Even when you’re afraid. Especially when you’re afraid. Because that’s where real growth begins.

This article is special because I would like to see more Ecuadorian developer working aboard if you reading this let me give you an advice give an opportunity to this type of jobs and if you wanna learn more or if you have doubts hit my DM. I'm open to help.
