I'm ready to write this story. This is an story about me, about how I fall down and I wake up about how the life of a person can be destroyed in seconds. 

I'm Junior a 26 years old healthy man working as a software engineer from a in a Ecuador town for international companies. I been dealing with my mental health since a year. I can remember clearly how this start. 

I'm a person full of challenges that wish to accomplish all their goals. One of them was sharing knowledge for other devs in internet so I decide to create my own Youtube Channel.

I thought everything was ok!. 
I start the channel. I create my own website and I create some web apps for my Porfolio. 
I did a few livestreams and I receive good feedback from community. 
I've been working four years and I've been doing this while I was with perseverance getting more muscles because oh yeah, I was going to the gym. 

Never in my life I felt more stronger and healthy in my life a quick background always I was the skinny and sick boy. I was living the live wish to have I leave my parent's house I can pay and buy anything I want 
Thanks
