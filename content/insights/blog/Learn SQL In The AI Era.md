##  Will AI Replace SQL Knowledge?

Many believe that with AI tools, learning SQL is no longer necessary. The truth is different: **SQL remains an essential skill** for anyone working with data. Mastering the basics allows you to make the most of AI tools and solve problems in real time.

Imagine being in a meeting and your boss asks for a quick reportâ€¦ would you only rely on ChatGPT, or would you know how to write the query in seconds?

##  What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) was developed in the 1970s at IBM and became an ANSI and ISO standard in 1986.  
Itâ€™s the most widely used language for **querying, manipulating, and structuring data** in relational databases.

## Main Components of SQL

Before diving into examples, letâ€™s review the key building blocks of SQL:

- **Queries:** Instructions to retrieve data from the database.

- **Clauses:** Parts of a query (e.g., SELECT, FROM, WHERE).

- **Predicates:** Logical conditions that return true or false.

- **Expressions:** Values or calculations used inside queries.

- **Statements:** Complete blocks of code that perform an action.

- **White Space:** Spaces, tabs, and line breaks that make code readable (ignored by SQL).


##  Creating Databases and Tables

### Create a Database

Depending on the database engine, syntax may vary:

- **MySQL:** Allows character sets and collations.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_database_name 
  CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
  COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

- **SQL Server:** Often includes file specifications and configurations.

- **PostgreSQL:** Offers flexible encoding and settings.


### Create a Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
  CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  FirstName VARCHAR(255),
  LastName VARCHAR(255),
  Age INT,
  Email VARCHAR(255),
  RegistrationDate DATE
);
```

##  Basic SQL Queries

### Select Data

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'London' AND Country = 'UK'
ORDER BY LastName ASC;
```

- `SELECT`: columns to retrieve
- `FROM`: source table
- `WHERE`: filters results
- `ORDER BY`: sorts results

### Insert Data

```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (FirstName, LastName, Age, Email)
VALUES ('Ana', 'Lopez', 28, 'ana@example.com');
```

### Update Records

```sql
UPDATE Customers
SET Age = 29
WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```

### Delete Records

```sql
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```

## Beyond the Basics

Once youâ€™ve mastered the essentials, explore advanced SQL concepts:

- **Joins:** Combine data from multiple tables (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS).

- **Subqueries:** Queries nested inside other queries.

- **Aggregate Functions:** `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` with `GROUP BY`.

- **Window Functions:** Advanced calculations across related rows.

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Temporary result sets for reuse.

- **Recursive Queries:** Handle hierarchical data structures.
